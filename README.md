# Data Analytics Internship
My projects for an internship program at Suven Consultants &amp; Technology Pvt. Ltd.

## Project 1: Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data
### Dataset
Download the weather dataset from this Google drive link.

The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for last 10 years starting from 2006-04-01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016-09-09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in the Northern Europe.

### Goal
Transform the raw data into information and then convert it into knowledge. By -
* Perform data cleaning,
* Perform analysis for testing the (given) Hypothesis &
* Put-forth conclusion by writing a blog article. Blog should be as descriptive as possible with relevant visualizations to prove your point.

### Null Hypothesis
The Null Hypothesis (H0) is "Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming."

The H0 means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period. So you are basically resampling your data from hourly to monthly, then comparing the same month over the 10 year period. Support your analysis by appropriate visualizations using matplotlib and / or seaborn library.
